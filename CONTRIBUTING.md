# Contributing

We, as YunoJuno, will be building this app out to support our specific
requirements. New features will be added at our convenience.

All of which means, if the app isn't currently supporting _your_ use case,
**get involved**!

The usual rules apply:

1. If you see something that's wrong, or something that's missing, open an
issue. NB please take a minute to verify that your issue is not already
covered by an existing issue.

2. If you want to fix something, or add a new feature / backend etc. then:

* Fork the repo
* Run the tests locally: `python manage.py test test_app request_profiler`
* Create a local branch (ideally named after the related issue,
  beginning with the issue number, e.g. `1-add-template-timings`)
* Write some code
* Write some tests to prove your code works
* Commit it
* Send a pull request

Other than that we'll work it out as we go along.
